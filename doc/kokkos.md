# Kokkos Project
Kokkos is a computation model for high performance computing (HPC). These abstraction layers are designed specifically to isolate software developers from fluctuation and diversity in hardware details yet provide portability and high levels of performance across many architectures. We use its implementation as an embedded C++ library. See documentation [Kokkos documentation](https://kokkos.org/documentation/)
